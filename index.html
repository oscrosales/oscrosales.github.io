                    development as I love the feeling of satisfaction when
                    completing a project! I am eager to learning and adapting to new
                    technology!<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm currently in search for a co-op or internship for my work-
                    integrated learning term and I'm open to exploring any opportunities
                    related to my field of study. I hope to grow as an IT professional, being
                    able to provide effective, secure, and scalable business solutions.<br>

                <p class="hidden text">
                    Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Oscar Rosales, and I am
                    currently studying Business Information Technology in my
                    final academic term. I have a passion for web and software
                    development as I love the feeling of satisfaction when
                    completing a project!<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm currently in search for a co-op or internship for my work-
                    integrated learning term and I'm open to exploring any opportunities
                    related to my field of study. I hope to grow as an IT professional, being
                    able to provide effective, secure, and scalable business solutions.<br>
                    <br>
                    A few unrelated facts about me:
                    <br>• I'm very passionate about cars, Pokémon, and anime
                </p>
